| ----------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **1. Suspicious Sender Address**    | The domain `secure-banking-alerts.com` is not a verified or known banking institution.                                           |
| **2. Shortened URL**                | The email includes a suspicious shortened link: `http://bit.ly/secure-verification-alert` (commonly used to mask phishing URLs). |
| **3. Urgent Language**              | Phrases like *“Failure to respond within 24 hours”* and *“immediately”* are tactics to create panic.                             |
| **4. No Personalization**           | The email uses *“Dear Customer”* instead of the recipient's actual name — a sign of mass phishing campaigns.                     |
| **5. Threat of Account Suspension** | This fear-based tactic is commonly used to trick users into quick action.                                                        |
| **6. Generic Signature**            | Signed off as *“Secure Banking Alerts Team”* with no employee name or contact info.                                              |
| **7. Unusual URL Domain**           | `secure-banking-alerts.com` is not associated with any registered, reputable financial institutions.                             |
| **8. Missing Security Details**     | No digital signature or HTTPS link to a valid banking site.                                                                      |
